# netflix-clone
This is a clone for the official website of netflix. This clone website has a few tweaks just to make it a little bit original.
This website was reated using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
CSS concepts such as flex-box model was used to align contents on the website while media queries were used to optimize the site for mobie responsiveness
The main JavaScript concept used for this site was EventListener, where we listened for clicks on the website.
